OpenAI was initially founded in 2015 by Sam Altman, Elon Musk, Ilya Sutskever and Greg Brockman as a 
non-profit organization with the stated goal to “advance digital intelligence in the way that is most 
likely to benefit humanity as a whole.” The company assembled a team of the best researchers in the 
field of AI to pursue the goal of building AGI in a safe way.

The early years of OpenAI were marked with rapid experimentation. The company made significant progress 
on research in deep learning and reinforcement learning, and released ‘OpenAI Gym’ in 2016, a toolkit 
for developing and comparing reinforcement learning algorithms. 

OpenAI showcased the capabilities of these reinforcement learning algorithms through its ‘OpenAI Five’ 
project in 2018, which trained five independent AI agents to play a complex multiplayer online battle 
arena game called ‘Dota 2’. Despite operating independently, these agents learned to work as a cohesive 
team to coordinate strategies within the game.
